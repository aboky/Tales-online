# tales
An very basic online game I've made to test phaser3 and socket.io ... and for fun of course.



## Launch the game
Clone the project then launch the server by running **node index.js** finally launch the game with **npm run start**. Go to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/) to discover tales online !
